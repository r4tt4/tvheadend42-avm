# tvheadend42-avm
tvheadend4.2 packages optimized for AVM Fritz!OS 7.01 Sat>IP Service

With Update to Fritz!OS 7.01 on my Cable Box and my DVB-C Repeater using Sat>IP was broken with tvheadend. 
I opened a bug report https://tvheadend.org/issues/5365 and got a fix for tvheadend.

So finally with the Update on libreelec v9 the "good" builds of tvheadend came back.

I created my own, fixed builds for RPi2 and WeTek Play Device. With that tvheadend works w/o problems.
